## Discription:
mainly this code is integrated with the cocodateset's API (http://cocodataset.org/#home) for obejects images, due to huge no. of images are present with large size,so its better to connect it's API rather than doing it manually...
### NOTE:
1.>when you run this code for first time, it will download some sorece....(it may take some time).....so keep patience......

2.>for image_detection,run {object_detection_image.py} form the above folder(first it will download some sorece,if u run this for first time).

3.>for live_detection(webcame), run {object_detection_webcame.py} form the above folder.

4.>only 2 sample is present for tesing in {Test_imges} folder. If u want u can add more images for tesing.
